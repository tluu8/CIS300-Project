        <h2>Paint Finishes</h2>

        <p>
            Paint sheen refers to how shiny or matte paint looks when it's dry. There are five basic sheens:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="style">Matte paint</span>, also known as flat, is the standard for most walls as it has a velvety texture 
                and the least amount of sheen. This sheen hides imperfections well and the painted surface 
                creates very little glare. However, walls with this finish can be difficult to wash.</li>
            <li><span class="style">Eggshell paint</span> has a moderate amount of sheen so it hides imperfections and produces relatively
                 little glare. This durable paint is also fairly washable and is the best choice for walls in 
                 high-trafficked areas such as your living room or bathroom.</li>
            <li><span class="style">Satin paint</span> is similar to eggshell but slightly more glossy. 
                Some manufacturers offer satin in place of eggshell while others offer both.</li>
            <li><span class="style">Semi-gloss paint</span> is used in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and similar areas that need 
                the high washability and moisture-resistance of glossier paint.</li>
            <li><span class="style">Gloss paint</span> is traditionally used on trim, doors, and cabinets because of its durability and easy-to-wash surface. 
                Its high-gloss finish also reflects a lot of light, which makes small but detailed elements pop with color.</li>
        </ul>
