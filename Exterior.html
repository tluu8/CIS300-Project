        <h2>Exterior Paint</h2>

        <h3> What Is Exterior Paint?</h3>

        <p>
            Exterior paint contains high-quality flexible resin binders that expand and 
            contract with the surface they cover. There is a blend of additives for leveling
            and to protect against staining, fading, and mildew. Most exterior paints also 
            include UV protection to help the pigments maintain their color. Exterior paints 
            contain more resins and tend to be softer than interior paints so they can adjust 
            to temperature and environmental extremes (weather-resistance).
        </p>

        <h3>Base</h3>

        <p>
            Exterior paints were commonly oil-based but modern formulations have made some 
            water-based paints as good as or better than the oil paints. Oil-based paints 
            tend to give off more VOCs than water-based, but the stronger chemicals are 
            present in both. Thererfore, it cannot be used for interior since it may harm our health.
