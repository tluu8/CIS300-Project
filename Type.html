        <h2>Types of paint</h2>

        <p>Before starting painting, you should have basic knowledges of paint.
           It's important to know what type of paint is on the walls or any surfaces.
           That’s because you don’t want to paint one type of paint over the other. 
           The compounds in different paints can cause them not to adhere properly.
           There are 3 main types of paint on the market, oil, acrylic, and latex based paints.
        </p>

        <h3> What Is Water-Based Paint and When to Use?</h3>

        <p>
            Water-based paint, also known as latex, is the most common type of paint for home use. 
            This fast-drying paint cleans up with soap and water, is environmentally responsible with 
            fewer VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and has excellent performance. 
            Latex paint is also known for its flexibility to withstand movement and its ability to 
            prevent mildew and moisture from getting into your home.
            This type of paint is good for general painting projects like doors, walls, and ceilings.
        </p>

        <h3> What Is Oil-Based Paint and When to Use?</h3>

        <p>
            Also known as alkyds, this high-gloss paint has a longer drying time and form a harder, 
            longer-lasting coating than latex paint, so you're less likely to see brush strokes. 
            However, alkyds are typically more expensive than latex paint, can have a strong odor when drying, 
            and typically contain more VOCs. Use these for any surfaces where you want the finish to be durable 
            and last a long time, like trim and cabinets.
        </p>

        <h3> What Is Acrylic Paint and When to Use?</h3>

        <p>
            Acrylic paint, like latex paint, is made of acrylic resin. The difference is that,
            while latex is water-based, acrylic is chemical-based. 
            The chemicals allow the paint to expand and contract with the weather and temperature, 
            making it a good choice for home exteriors.
