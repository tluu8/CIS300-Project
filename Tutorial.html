        <h2>How To Paint</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Choosing the Right Paint</h3>

        <p>
            While any paint can give a home a quick facelift, a premium paint can truly transform 
            a home’s interior and make it last. A premium paint offers a smoother, more uniform appearance,
            as well as much better coverage, than an economy paint. Because a home is a major investment,
            premium paint provides the long-term protection it deserves.
        </p>

        <h4>SELECTING THE RIGHT GLOSS</h4>

        <p>
            The gloss level you choose for your paint project can have a significant impact on 
            both appearance and maintenance. A color in a higher gloss paint will appear brighter 
            and richer than the same color in a lower gloss. Also, higher glosses will have better 
            washability and stain resistance, though they may also highlight defects and imperfections on a surface.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Flat paints are a good choice for adult bedrooms, living or dining rooms, and ceilings.</li> 
            <li>Eggshell or Satin paints can be used for high-traffic areas such as hallways, family rooms or children’s bedrooms.</li> 
            <li>Semi-Gloss and Gloss paints are ideal for kitchens, bathrooms, utility areas, woodwork, doors and trim</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Choosing the Right Primer</h3>

        <p>
            Priming before painting ensures superior adhesion of the paint to the surface, helps cover darker colored paints 
            and stains, and creates a smoother, more even finish. There are many different primers, each suited for a particular 
            surface, such as drywall, metal or concrete, or to address a particular problem, such as to cover stains or to prevent tannin bleeding.

        <h3>Step 4: Preparing to Paint</h3>

        <p>
            When it comes to painting, proper preparation of the work area and painting
             surface is important to simplify the project and achieve better results.
        </p>

        <h4>PREPARATION</h4>

        <div id="tutorialPic">

            <section>
            <p>
                Clear the area before you begin. If that’s not possible, 
                move large furniture to the center of the room and cover it with plastic sheeting.
            </p>

            <p>
                Cover the floor with plastic sheeting and, using safe-release painter’s masking tape 
                (usually blue in color), adhere the sheeting to the baseboards around the room’s perimeter. 
                Place a heavier canvas dropcloth atop the plastic to avoid an overly slick surface.
            </p>

            <p> 
                Remove all hardware and anything hanging on the walls, such as electrical plates, 
                cable TV outlets, curtains, art and nails. To cover chandeliers or other fixtures 
                you cannot or do not want to remove, cut plastic sheeting to size and wrap and 
                tape the item.
            </p>

            <p>
                Clean the surface of any dirt, dust, wax, grease, oils or other contaminants. 
                Use a mild detergent and water or a commercial wall-cleaning product to clean the walls.
                Rinse the surface with clean water and allow it to dry.
            </p>

            <p>            
                Repair, patch and caulk all voids, cracks and holes where necessary. 
                Lightly sand repairs to achieve a smooth, even surface. 
                Sand glossy surfaces to provide a roughened surface for good adhesion.
                Remove dust thoroughly before painting.
                Apply the appropriate primer.
            </p>

         <h3>Step 5: Painting</h3>

         <p>
            Always start at the top of any surface and work your way down. Follow this order when painting:

                <p>
                    Use a brush to paint a 2-inch-wide strip along the ceiling and the floor, 
                    and around any woodwork. Use a roller, coming as close to the edges as possible,
                    to create a clean, uniform finish.

        <h3>Step 6: Cleaning Up and Properly Disposing of Paint</h3>

        <p>
            Water-based paints make cleaning up fast and easy. Clean any spills with a damp cloth before they dry. 
            Clean brushes, rollers and other tools with soap and water.

                <ul>
                    <li>Try to buy only the amount of paint you’ll need for your project.</li>
                    <li>Save small amounts of leftover paint for future touch-ups. 
                        To keep the paint fresh for future use, 
                        put a layer of plastic wrap over the mouth of the can before replacing the lid securely.</li>
                    <li>Cans with completely dried paint residue may be disposed of in ordinary household trash. 
                        Leave the lid off the container so the collector can see that the paint has dried.</li>
                    <li><b>Never pour leftover paint down a drain on into a storm sewer.</b></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>PREVENTATIVE STEPS</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>Washing dirt from painted walls before it accumulates not only improves appearance, 
                        it reduces the chance of the dirt becoming permanently embedded in the paint.</li>
                    <li>Make sure to check for dirt periodically and assume 
                        it will be present in and near cooking areas (airborne cooking oil) 
                        and on areas that are frequently touched.</li>
                </ul>
