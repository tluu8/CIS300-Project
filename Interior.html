        <h3> What Is Interior Paint?</h3>

        <p>
            Interior paints are specially formulated to be used indoors. 
            They are designed to adhere to different surfaces, reflect or absorb light,
            and withstand abrasion and wear of daily contact and cleaning. 
            They also donâ€™t normally have to withstand the expansion and contraction of 
            the freeze-thaw cycle or exposure to the harsher elements of nature. 
            And it cannot be used for exterior.
        </p>

        <h3>Base</h3>

        <p>
            Interior paints can be water-based, which includes latex and acrylic paints,
            or oil-based such as alkyd paints. Water and oil-bases offer different 
            adhesive properties and use. Interior paints are designed to have lower VOCs 
            to minimize health risks due to off-gassing.
